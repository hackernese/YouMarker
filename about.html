            <p>

                &#8618; YouMarker is an open-sourced project which helps you keeping track of your youtube videos,
                this can be useful if you are intending to study a 5-10 long hours course from youtube or 
                watch from so many sources and each source has its own specific timestamp indicating some information.
                <br>
                &#8618; It can be a bit of a hassle to keep tracks of everything you have watched and not knowing what 
                that video was or which section of it that holds the information that you wish to recall.
